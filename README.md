## Short description

This project based on delivered graphic design.
To create this page I used [Create React App] and also [React-Router-Dom], [React-Redux], [React-Bootstrap].

## Live version:

Please see: [here](https://krzychu700.github.io/React-Shop#/1/name/desc)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
